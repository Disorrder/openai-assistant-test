## Why 5G

When considering your home internet, it's essential to weigh the benefits of 5G over traditional wired connections. 5G provides a high-speed, reliable internet solution that matches the performance of fibre but with added flexibility and convenience. Unlike fibre, which requires extensive groundwork and physical cables to be laid, 5G utilizes advanced wireless technology to deliver ultra-fast internet directly to your home. This means quicker installation, minimal disruption, and immediate access to cutting-edge internet speeds without the need for digging up your property.

## What is rainOne?

rainOne is one plan for home and phones. It includes two rain mobile phone SIMs loaded with gigs, SMS, and minutes, and one unlimited home internet 5G SIM and the 101 5G smart router free-to-use, all for R595. You can level up your plan to get additional monthly data and minutes (at R75 a level) or speed up to increase your 5G home internet speed (at R200 a level).

## How do I get more mobile data and minutes?

2. Increase Monthly Allocation: You can also increase your monthly allocation by levelling up. Each level costs an additional R75. The benefits of levelling up include receiving the same allocation on both SIM cards, which saves you money, and unlocks extra buy more benefits:

# Billing

Yes, a debit card that is provisioned for online transactions from any of the following banks can be used when purchasing rainOne:

- FNB
- Standard Bank
- ABSA
- Nedbank
- Capitec

## How does billing work

### The first month

When you buy a rainOne service, your first charge will be on the day of purchase and will be a pro-rata amount. What this means is that you will only pay for the remaining days up until your selected payment date. For example:

- The date is the 15<sup>th</sup> of a month with 30 days in it
- You choose the base rainOne package at a price of R595 per month
- For the month you are currently in you will pay for only the 15 remaining days of the month, in this example we are halfway through the month so you would pay for the next half, an amount of R297.50
- The next month, on the 1<sup>st</sup>, you will be billed for the entire upcoming month, so at this point you would pay the full R595.

### The months thereafter

Every month you will be billed upfront for the coming month’s subscription. In the example of the base rainOne package at R595, you would pay the full amount for the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 30<sup>th</sup>, on the 1<sup>st</sup>. Your free mobile SIMs will also be topped up with the 2Gbs, 60 minutes and 100 SMS messages on the 1<sup>st</sup>.

## Available payment dates

Your payment date is the beginning of your payment cycle. Currently we allow you to set your payment date to any of the following days:

- 1<sup>st</sup>
- 15<sup>th</sup>
- 20<sup>th</sup>
- 25<sup>th</sup>

Any payment made on one of these dates is for the upcoming month in advance – example, if you choose the 15<sup>th</sup> of every month, your payment is for the 15<sup>th</sup> to the 15<sup>th</sup> of the next month. You can update your payment dates when you sign into your rain account on the website. Then click on the “billing” tab and scroll down to the date selector.

## How can I change my payment date?

**Postpaid customers**

- Login to the rain website at [www.rain.co.za](http://www.rain.co.za)
- Once you have logged in, click “billing” on the secondary menu bar.
- Then go to the payment date section and select “edit.”
- From here you can change your payment date to any of the available dates.

**Prepaid customers**

- For prepaid customers, please go to [our website](https://www.rain.co.za) contact support.

Take note, you can only change your payment date if your account is in good standing and if you have not changed your payment date in the last month

## My order payment was unsuccessful… what now?

First, please check with your bank that the card you’re using has 3D Secure (you might know it as MasterCard SecureCode or Verified by Visa) – that means it’s enabled for online transactions. If your card is 3D secure and you are still experiencing this problem, please contact your bank to investigate. An unsuccessful transaction is usually the result of one of the following reasons:

- The OTP has not been applied within the necessary timeframe​
- The bank card you are using is from an international bank which rain can’t process
- The card is being used or has been used under a different rain account​
- You've exceeded your online spend limit or you have insufficient funds
- Your bank card has expired.

## How do I track my refund?

Please note that once you’ve received approval on your refund, it will take between 7 to 10 business days from receipt of confirmation to reflect in your bank account. If you have still not received your refund after this timeframe, please contact us on [081 610 1000​](tel:081%20610%201000%E2%80%8B).

## Why was I billed for a service I cancelled?

- Please note that when you request cancellation, it will be scheduled for the end of your billing cycle.
- If you had taken up the service prior to October 2022, your service was billed in arrears, or "post-paid." This means you pay for the service after you have used it.

The reason you have been billed after the service has been cancelled is that this is the final invoice for the service.

- If you are a pre-paid customer, you will not be billed after your services are cancelled. If you believe you have been, please contact support.

## Why was I not billed?

The reason you were not billed could be:

- The bank card used for regular payments may have expired, changed, or been cancelled.
- The online transaction/spend limit may need to be adjusted to accommodate the payment amount.
- The transaction exceeded the limit at the time of the transaction.
- Your bank card may be expired.

## How do I update my card payment details?

To change your payment details:

- Log in to your rain profile at [www.rain.co.za](http://www.rain.co.za/).
- On the "My Account" tile, select "Manage."
- In the "Payment Method" section, select "Edit."
- Enter the new card details and follow the prompts.

## Why was I billed on the wrong date?

If the payment failed on your regular payment date, an attempt will be made on the next bill run date to prevent interruption. Billing will then resume on your preferred payment date thereafter.

Another reason you might be billed on the wrong date is if you changed your preferred payment date shortly before or after your initial payment date.

## I was billed more than I expected, why?

You can view the invoice on your rain profile under “my account.” The invoice provides more information regarding the charge. The second page includes a statement of your account.

Possible reasons for the extra charge could be:

- A pro-rata charge
- Addition of a level up or speed up
- Previously missed payments
- Purchase of additional services

## I was billed half of my normal monthly rate, why?

We understand that unexpected situations arise, and we want you to stay connected. If you do not have enough in your account to make the full payment for your monthly bill, a portion of your monthly bill may be charged as a partial payment, to keep you connected until you are within means to make the full payment.

## Can I suspend or pause my rain services?

No, you cannot suspend or pause your services. However, your services may be suspended if you miss payment.

## Can I pay later without changing my payment date?

We understand that things happen, and we want you to stay connected. To make a payment arrangement, please call us at 081 610 1000. One of our friendly consultants will assist you with a "Promise to Pay" arrangement.

"Promise to Pay" allows you to make a one-time payment at a later date without changing your recurring payment date.

## I paid in store. Why is my balance not reflecting this?

# Network

## I’m unsatisfied with my network experience. I need help

**To ensure that you receive the best experience possible, please do the following.**

- Try running a speed test on speedtest.net to check if you’re getting appropriate speeds for your package

If the test results are not adequate based on your package, then you will need to optimise your router’s location by following the basic optimisation guide.

- Make sure your signal is good by referring to the signal bar on the Rain101 router, or on your router’s LED indicators

**Need help with WiFi?**

- When trying to connect, make sure that you are using the password on the device or the one that you have customized.
- If you find your device signal dropping when moving away from the router. Please check that you are connected to both 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz wifi bands.
- 5Ghz is preferred when closer to the router and 2.4Ghz works better when further away.

**Need help with your device?**

- If your device is not powering on, test the device on different power outlets to see if it powers on. Alternatively, contact support.
- If your device is not connecting to the network, try restarting it.
- If you forgot your wifi password or device login, try resetting your device.

## How do I check my coverage?

Enter your address on [our coverage map](https://www.rain.co.za/our-network) and use the map key in the corner to see if you’re within coverage.

Please note you will need to be within coverage in order to purchase a rainOne plan.

Please note, the coverage map is an indication of coverage, not a guarantee.

## I’m connected to WiFi but can’t get onto the internet

**My device says “connected with no internet”**

- Try checking if there is a connection signal on your router, if the signal indicator is red, try following the basic optimisation guide.
- An unsuccessful debit order – your rain account may be in arrears. Sign in to my rain to pay now and get back online

My 4G device has no internet accessThis might be because of your APN settings. For phones and most other devices your APN settings are automatically set up. If not, the default APN settings are as follows:​

APN name: rain​
All other settings can be left blank​

If it’s not your APN settings, this might be the cause:​

- You’re using the incorrect device - make sure you’re using a 4G enabled device for your 4G mobile SIM. If you are on a **4G for phones** product, your SIM will only work in a 4G phone.​
- You’ve reached your gig limit – you can manage your limit on my rain​
- An unsuccessful debit order – your rain account may be in arrears. Sign in to my rain to pay now and get back online

## Basic Optimisation guide

To ensure you get the best performance from your 5G router, optimizing its location is crucial. Here are some simple steps to help you find the perfect spot for your router:

- 1\. Position Near Windows
  - If possible, place your router near a window facing the direction of the nearest 5G tower. This can help enhance the signal strength by reducing the number of obstacles between your router and the 5G signal source.
- 2\. Experiment with Different Locations
  - Try placing your router in different spots and test the signal strength at each location. Use the built-in signal strength indicator on your router or a speed test app to measure performance. Choose the spot where you get the best signal and speed.
- 3\. Use the 5GHz Band
  - For devices that are close to the router, connect to the 5GHz Wi-Fi band. This band offers higher speeds and less interference than the 2.4GHz band, but it has a shorter range. Use the 2.4GHz band for devices that are further away from the router.

By following these steps, you can significantly improve the performance of your 5G router, ensuring faster speeds and a more reliable internet connection throughout your home.

## The signal is bad on my 101 router, what should I do?

- You should follow the steps in the basic optimization guide. While following these steps, please make use of the signal indicator on the screen of your 101 device.
- If your signal seems good on your 101 device, but you’re still having a speed problem, please make sure that you are connected to the correct Wi-Fi (high speed/low speed) depending on your distance from the router.
- Please conduct a speed test on speedtest.net to check the speeds you are getting. Note that the service does not offer guaranteed, symmetrical speeds.

## My network is slow, what should I do?

- You should follow the steps in the basic optimization guide. The reason for this is that poorer signal could be causing poorer speeds.
- If your signal seems good on your 101 device, but you’re still having a speed problem, please make sure that you are connected to the correct Wi-Fi (high speed/low speed) depending on your distance from the router.
- Please conduct a speed test on speedtest.net to check the speeds you are getting. Note that the service does not offer guaranteed, symmetrical speeds.

## Why is my router showing ‘No Network?’

- If you have just received your package, it may take up to 24 hours for the service to be activated. So, if you’ve received your package recently and you’re not able to connect, please give it up to 24 hours for activation to complete. If it still shows ‘no network’ after 24 hours, please contact support.
- Next, you should check the router’s location within your home. You should follow the basic optimization guide to ensure that you have the best signal possible.
- It may also be because you’re out of coverage. Please check that your current location of use is within coverage.
- If you have changed any device settings which may affect your connection to the network, please reset your device.
- Another reason could be faults on the network in your area. Please contact support.

## How does loadshedding affect my network?

We at rain try our best to ensure that all our towers have complete backup power supplies in the event of loadshedding. However, we cannot guarantee that all of our 5G towers will be up throughout the loadshedding period. In the event of your 5G tower going down, your device could possibly connect to an alternate tower, which will act as a temporary connection until your tower’s power is restored.

## I’ve got a rain service, what happens if there’s an interruption to the network in my area?

It could be that the 5G tower you normally connect to is currently out of service. This happens when there are power outages or cable breaks in the area. We try to solve these as fast as possible, but sometimes this can last several hours as it may be due factors beyond our control. In the event of your 5G tower going down, your device could possibly connect to an alternate tower, which will act as a temporary connection until your tower is restored.

## Why are my voice SIMs working but not my router?

Our 4G mobile network provides nationwide coverage. Therefore, if you are in an area without 5G coverage while using our 5G service, only your 4G mobile services will be available.

## Why am I having trouble with gaming on the rain network?

- Make sure your signal is fine and your speeds are aligned with your package.
- Make sure your console or device is connected via LAN cable where possible
- Check if the server that you’re playing on is healthy

## How many devices can I connect to my router?

While you can connect up to 124 devices, it is important to remember that each additional device you connect to your router will take a share of the bandwidth, so this might also influence your experience connecting to the internet.

## How can I connect to the Rain101 router?

- You can use the QR code function by scanning the QR code on the screen of your 101 with your mobile device to manually connect.
- For devices that cannot scan QR codes, you can manually enter the password which can be found on the back of your router or in the menu under ‘wifi’
- You can use the WPS button
- You can connect using the ethernet or LAN cable

## Why do I not see my WiFi network when searching for it?

- Make sure your router is switched on
- Make sure that you are looking for the correct network. If you have customised the name of the network, you won’t find it labelled on the device
- Your device may not support the WiFi bands or technology of the router
- In the unlikely event that the device is faulty, we can help you troubleshoot or replace the equipment. If you think this is the case, please call support.

## How do I change my WiFi name and password?

- Make sure that you are connected to the wifi that you wish to edit.
- You will need to login to your router’s device interface. To do this, open your browser and in the URL bar type the code that is printed on your device under the WEB UI, IP or WEB Login section. It should either be 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.8.1.
- You will be prompted to log in, if your device has a login password printed on it, please use that, otherwise use “admin” or the custom password you’ve set. Leave the ‘Username’ section as is. Note that your login password might also be the same as your wifi password.
- Navigate to the Wifi section on your device interface
- Fill in the fields for ‘name’ and ‘password’ to your own preference.
- Click ‘apply’ or ‘save’
- Please note that your device will then reboot, and all devices will need to login again with the new information.
